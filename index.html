         <p>Madden Football has changed the way that people view football games. With the online access and the addition of connected franchise mode, many fans have asked us how we like to play <a href="https://www.maddenguides.com/madden-strategy/">Madden Football</a>. With the different integrated game modes, there is a game mode for every football fan in Madden Football. Let’s take a look at the different ways that Madden fans can find the mode that fits them best.</p>
         <h2>Madden vs. CPU</h2>
         <p>The most commonly played mode in Madden is playing against the CPU. This is the easiest way to play a quick game and have fun playing with your favorite players. EA Sports has worked hard on Madden Football over the years to make it the most realistic football simulator possible. The advancements in Madden’s Artificial Intelligence have added the realistic aspect of football that we are all looking for. Players now act and move much like they do in real life. Changing the difficulty settings in the game controls can allow you to achieve a challenging game every time to hit the field. This is a great mode for newer players to get used to the controls and learn how to call offenses and defenses.</p>
         <h2>Madden Connected Franchise Mode</h2>
         <p>Franchise mode gives players the chance to not only play with their favorite players on the field but also make every business decision for the team off the field. Now you get to decide which rookies you will draft and if you will go after that free agent that could take your team all the way to the Super bowl. Franchise mode is a great mode for those gamers that want more out of a football title than just playing football. A gamer can find hours of fun and work after every game they play on the field if they want to, or they can have the CPU do all the work for them. Gamers can turn their franchise into a dynasty by playing over many seasons.</p>

These are the players that are the best at Madden Football and are practicing for upcoming tournaments or leagues. For the casual gamer, online games are a great way to improve your skills and become a better player. The speed of online games is much faster, and the competition is much higher than playing against the CPU. You get to see how the game are played at tournaments. It allows you to get a sense of if you are ready or not for Madden Football tournaments.</p>
